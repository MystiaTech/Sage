# Firebase Configuration Required

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Replace google-services.json

The current `google-services.json` file is a **PLACEHOLDER** and will **NOT** work.

### Steps to get your real google-services.json:

1. Follow the instructions in `/FIREBASE_SETUP.md` in the project root
2. Download the real `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
3. Replace the file in this directory: `android/app/google-services.json`

### Quick Link:
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Package Name (must match):
```
com.sage.sage
```

Without the real Firebase configuration file, household sharing will not work across devices!

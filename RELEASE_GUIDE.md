# Release Guide for Sage - Google Play & F-Droid

## üîê Step 1: Create Signing Key (Required for Google Play)

### Generate Keystore:
```bash
# Run this in your terminal (uses Java keytool)
cd android/app
keytool -genkey -v -keystore sage-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias sage-key
```

**When prompted, enter:**
- Password: (choose a strong password - SAVE THIS!)
- First and last name: Danielle Sapelli
- Organizational unit: (press Enter to skip)
- Organization: (press Enter to skip)
- City: (your city)
- State: (your state)
- Country code: US (or your country)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Save these securely:
- Keystore password
- Key alias: `sage-key`
- Keystore file: `sage-release-key.jks`

### Configure Signing:

Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=sage-key
storeFile=sage-release-key.jks
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Add to .gitignore:**
```
android/key.properties
android/app/sage-release-key.jks
```

### Update build.gradle.kts:

Add this to `android/app/build.gradle.kts` before `android {`:

```kotlin
// Load keystore properties
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("key.properties")
val keystoreProperties = Properties()
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}
```

Then update `signingConfigs` inside `android {`:

```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}
```

And update `buildTypes`:

```kotlin
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
    }
}
```

## üì¶ Step 2: Build Signed Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for app bundle (preferred for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

Output:
- APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- AAB: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## üé® Step 3: Create Store Assets

## üîß Step 5: Google Play Console Setup

**First release timeline:** Usually 1-3 days for review

## ü§ñ Step 6: F-Droid Release

F-Droid has stricter requirements:

### Requirements Checklist:

‚úÖ **Open Source:**
- Code is open source ‚úì
- Need to publish to GitHub public repo

‚úÖ **No Proprietary Dependencies:**
- ‚ùå **ISSUE:** Firebase is proprietary
- ‚ùå Google Services (google-services.json)

### F-Droid Options:

**Option 1: Remove Firebase for F-Droid build** (Recommended)
- Create build flavor without Firebase
- F-Droid users get local-only mode
- No household cloud sync, but everything else works

**Option 2: Fork for F-Droid**
- Maintain separate F-Droid version
- Strip out Firebase completely
- Local-only storage

**Option 3: Skip F-Droid**
- Focus on Google Play Store only
- Provide APK downloads from GitHub releases

### To Prepare for F-Droid:

1. **Publish code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Create repo at github.com/mystiatech/sage
   git remote add origin git@github.com:mystiatech/sage.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Add LICENSE file:**
   - Choose license (MIT, GPL-3.0, Apache-2.0)
   - Add LICENSE file to root

3. **Submit to F-Droid:**
   - Open issue at [fdroiddata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues)
   - Provide GitHub repo URL
   - They'll review and add to F-Droid

4. **Or:** Self-host F-Droid repo
   - Simpler than official F-Droid
   - Users add your repo to F-Droid app

## üìã Final Checklist

### Google Play Store:
- [ ] Create signing key
- [ ] Configure signing in build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Build signed AAB
- [ ] Create screenshots (2-8 images)
- [ ] Create feature graphic (1024x500)
- [ ] Write store description
- [ ] Set up privacy policy hosting
- [ ] Create developer account ($25)
- [ ] Upload and submit for review

### F-Droid:
- [ ] Remove Firebase or create separate build flavor
- [ ] Publish code to GitHub
- [ ] Add LICENSE file
- [ ] Submit to F-Droid (or self-host repo)
- [ ] Wait for F-Droid review (can take weeks)

### Both:
- [ ] Test signed release build thoroughly
- [ ] Verify Firebase works with signed build
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
- [ ] Update version number for each release

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Build for Google Play (signed AAB)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Build for testing (signed APK)
flutter build apk --release

# Check what's in the AAB
cd build/app/outputs/bundle/release
unzip -l app-release.aab
```

## üì± Version Management

Current version: `1.1.0+2`

For each release:
1. Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD_NUMBER`
3. Example: `1.2.0+3` (version 1.2.0, build 3)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Never lose your signing key!** You can't update the app without it.
2. **Keep key.properties secure** - don't commit to git
3. **Test signed builds** before uploading to store
4. **Firebase requires google-services.json** - make sure it's the real one
5. **First release takes longer** - usually 1-3 days review
6. **Updates are faster** - usually hours after first approval

## üÜò Common Issues

**Build fails with signing error:**
- Check key.properties exists
- Verify passwords are correct
- Make sure storeFile path is relative to android/app/

**Firebase doesn't work in release:**
- Verify google-services.json is the real one (not placeholder)
- Check package name matches exactly
- Enable Firestore in Firebase Console

**Play Store rejects:**
- Update target SDK to latest (currently 34)
- Add privacy policy URL
- Complete content rating

**F-Droid rejects:**
- Remove all proprietary dependencies
- Use only FOSS libraries
- Provide full source code
